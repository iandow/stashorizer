Stashorizer is a bot that automatically downloads images from tweets in
which its name is "mentioned" in. If the image passes a safety check for 
adult content, violence, etc. then the bot will attempt to find faces in
the image and draw mustaches on each face. The both will then reply to the
original tweet with that mustache annotated image.
